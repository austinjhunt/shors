    """ Run shors algorithm to leverage quantum computing 
    to find prime factors of large number N.
    Using shor's involves setting some requirements around the guessed values
    of N's factors. Specifically, they can't be trivial factors of N. 
    Also, the period p such that the guess ^ p mod m * N = 1 must be even.
    When these criteria are not met, the process must be restarted with a new initial 
    guess g. The reasoning behind these criteria is outlined in the README of this folder. 

    NOTE: Although I have parameterized N (the number to be factored), this currently 
    will only work with N = 15 due to the underlying dependent methods shown in the 
    official documentation.
